I am currently working in the Operations Team of one of the largest private weather company in the world, Weathernews Inc. (WNI) Japan. I handle setting up data and communication services between vessels, operators and our weather operations team. We do ocean routeing service and provide weather technology-based solutions to thousands of marine vessels around the world.

I'm also a consultant for Ximity Inc., which is a startup company in the Philippines that focuses on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technologies. It is the company's goal to introduce IoT and AI platforms for optimizing retail services and creating new applications.

In the past, I researched on machine learning applications. I worked on improving robotic hand rehabilitation using biological signals such as Electromyography (EMG). I also worked with robots, assistive technology, prediction models and software development. You can find some of my old demos in: https://www.youtube.com/user/ShibataLab

Feel free to message me anytime if you're interested in the work that I do.
